Final Project: Pocket Words
Description: The following program creates a dictionary using the Merriam-Webster API, specifically the Collegiate Dictionary and
Spanish-English Dictionary. The application includes a searchbar, in which the user enters a word and presses a button to find
either the definition or the translation of the word. The translation button works from Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish.

Notes:
* The program takes a while to load up. If a message stating that the System UI is not responding, you can just press the 'Wait'
button and the program will continue as normal.
* The application outputs a legible output that includes the functional label (e.g. noun, transitive verb, adjective) and the actual
definition. However, the output is not well-organized.
